# Propel Example

An example project that uses `@capsule-cat/propel-forward`, `@capsule-cat/propel-express`, and `@capsule-cat/propel-sequelize` to create a simple API.

## Getting Started

To get started, run the following commands:

```bash
npm ci
```

This will install all of the dependencies for the project.

Then you can run:

```bash
npx nx serve example
```

This will start the server and you can visit http://localhost:3000 to see the API.

## Development

This package is not intended to be published to npm. It is only intended to be used as an example of how to use the `@capsule-cat/propel-*` packages.
