A set of packages to create clients and services quickly with a standard way
of wiring up dependencies and endpoints.

## Getting Started

To get started, run the following commands:

npm ci
```

This will install all of the dependencies for the project.

The `package.json` `scripts` section contains a number of commands that can be
run to perform various tasks. The most common tasks are:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will build the project.

```bash
npm run test
```

This will run the unit tests.

```bash
npm run lint
```

This will run the linter.

## Publishing

To publish a new version of the package, run the following commands:

```bash
npm run version
```

This will bump the version numbers and create a new commit and tag.

```bash
npm run publish
```

This will publish the packages to npm.
